Malware is currently a major security threat for computers and smartphones, with efforts being taken into improving malware detectors with behavior-based detection. In order to classify applications, malware detectors need some form of malicios behavior specification which are usually identified manually by researchers. We present a Linux implementation of the malspec-mining algorithm which automates this process. This algorithm recognizes such specifications by comparing known malicious and benign applications. The output consists of behavior patterns, which are specific to the inputted malware and that do not occur in benign applications.
