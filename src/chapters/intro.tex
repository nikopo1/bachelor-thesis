From large corporations to the average user, computer and network environment security is an important requirement to which malware is a threat. Malware, or malicious software, is software programmed and used by attackers in order to gain access to private computers, to obtain sensitive information or to simply disrupt normal computer operation.

Currently, malware written for Windows operating systems are more common than those written for Linux. Considering that operating systems which are based on the Linux kernel, such as Android, are are becoming more wide-spread, we can assume that better security for them will soon become a necessity. This supports the need for developing better tools for Linux malware analysis and improving malware detection methods.

This is the motivation for the project described in this paper: developing a Linux malware behavior miner.
